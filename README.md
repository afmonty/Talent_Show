# Talent Show

Many years ago, before the internet was a common tool, before youtube, my father had an idea for a startup.  It was to help people, kids, trying to get their video tapes and informtion to colleges more easily in their effort to get scholarships.  It never got off of the ground, so I thought I'd build a prototype of what it could have been. 

I am using React with Backbone collections and models to create an application where users, the talent, can upload videos of their 'talent' and submit it along with a letter or comments to talent agencies or schools.  The schools/agencies will then be able to accept or reject the submission and send a appropriate response to the talent.  This could streamline the scholarship program by allowing scouts access to a larger pool of talent and a quicker decision making ability. It would also allow talent to get themselves in front of agencies who can then help them acheive their carrer goals.
